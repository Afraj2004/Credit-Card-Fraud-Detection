# Fraud Detection Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs fraud detection analysis using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of transaction records with labeled fraud cases. It includes features such as transaction amount, type, time, and other relevant details.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud_detection_analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fraud_detection_analysis
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fraud_detection_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Analysis Process
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Conclusion and Insights

## Results
The notebook provides insights into fraud detection patterns and evaluates various machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for identifying fraudulent transactions.
